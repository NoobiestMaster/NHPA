    <p>
      Some of the ways in which medical professionals diagnose lung cancer is through looking at
      a person's past medical history, imaging tests, lab tests, lung biopsies, and sputum (mucus) cytoogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After diagnosis, a person might get more tests done to determine which stage of lung cancer they are in.
      Small Cell Lung Cancer has two stages: imited stage, where the cancer is only in one side of the chest and
      Extensive stage, where the cancer has spread throughout the lung and to the other lung and perhaps other organs.
      <br>
      Non-small cell lung cnacer has six stages:
      <br>Occult (hidden) stage, where the cancer is seen in the fluid and mucus, but not
      anywhere else
      <br>Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ), where the cancer is in the top layers of cell lining but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant
      areas of the body.
      <br>
      Stages I (divided into IA and IB), II (divided into IIA and IIB) and III (divided into IIIA and IIIB), where the cancer increases in size
      and spreads to other lymph nodes
      <br> Stage IV, where the cancer may have spread to the opposite lung, space around the lungs or heart, or other organs. ik

    <p>
      Treatment of Lung cancer depends on the type, stage, serverity and general health and wishes.
      Early stages of Non-cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, which include pneumonectomy, removal of an entire lung,
      Lobectomy, removal of a lobe of the lung, and segmentectomy or wedge resection, removal of part of a lobe.<br>
      One of the other treatment options is Radiofrequency ablation, which uses high-energy radiwaves to heat the tumour and kill the cancer cells.
      Another is Chemotherapy, which involves using medicine to kill the cancer cells. This is the usual treatment for Small cell lung cancer.
      Other treatment options include Radiotherapy, Targeted therapy, Immunotherapy and others. More information can be found
