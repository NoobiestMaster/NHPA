  <h3 class="subheading">Risk Factors</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most prominent risk factors is smoking and exposure to smoking. Current and Former smokers have a higher chance
    of getting lung cancer. Those who begin smoking at an early age, smoked for longer and more often have a higher chance of
    getting lung cancer. Non smokers may not be that safe either as if they are exposed to second hand smoking, they also have
    an increased risk of getting lung cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other Risk factors include exposure to asbestos, diesel exhaust and silica, increasing age, family history of lung
    cancer, history or chronic lung disease and a personal history of cancer.
  </p>
  <h3 class="subheading">How to minimise risk</h3>
<p>
  There is no proven way to completely prevent lung cancer, however, there are ways to help minimise the risk of getting it.
  One of the best ways is to not smoke or quit smoking and avoiding second-hand smoke (those exhaled from smokers).
  Avoiding radon and limiting or completely avoiding exposure to cancer causing agents. It is also a good idea to eat healthy
  and stay healthy as that will help the body remain strong. Simply by avoiding second hand smoking and not smoking will
  greatly reduce you chance of getting lung cancer.
