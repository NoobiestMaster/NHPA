    <p>
      There are two main types of lung cancer, each with there own individual sub types. The two types are: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      and Small Cell Lung cancer (SCLC). These two categories are based  on they cells that are affected by the cancer. There are more different types
      of lung cancer, however these are the most common.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Small Lung Cancer</h4>
    <p>
      Small Lung cancer often starts around the center of lungs. It grows and spreads faster than it's counterpart, thus making it
      more aggressive. It accounts for around 15% of the diagnosed. By the time it is detected, in over half of the cases, it has
      already spread past the lungs. Most people diagnosed with Small lung cancer live for a year and less than 7% survive 5.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Non Small Lung Cancer</h4>
    <p>
      None small lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma.
      <br>Adenocarcinoma starts in the mucus and produces cell that make up about 40% of lung cancers. It is the most common type of cancer
      <br>Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in cells lining the airways.
      <br>Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma usually starts around the center of the lung. Rarer than the other two types of
      non-small cell lung cancer and refers to any non-smal lung cancer that starts anywhere not in the lining and mucus.
