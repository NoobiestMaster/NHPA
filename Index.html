      <p>
        Lung Cancer is a when cancerious tumour is found in the lungs. It sarts
        when there is an uncontrolled cell growth, as all cancers do. It is the fifth
        most commonly diagnosed cancers in Australia and it is also the most
        common cause of death form cancer in Australia. Up to 9/10 lung cancers are
        caused by smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
        When cancer starts in the lungs, it is known as Primary Lung cancer. When it starts in another
        part of the body and has spread to the lungs, it is called secondary or metastatic cancer in
        the lung. The information on this site is about primary lung cancer.
      </p>

        Cancer occurs when there is a genetic mutation in the cell, specifically
        the one that dictates cell growth ro repair of damaged DNA. This leads to the cell dividing uncontrollably
        leading to the a build of up cell mass that is called a tumour.

      <h3 class="subheading">Why is it an NHPA area?</h3>
      <p>
        Lung cancer accounted for approximately 8.6% of all cancers diagnosed in 2019. It also accounted for approximately 18%
        of the deaths. This means, out of all the people who were diagnosed with cancer that year, almost 1/10 had lung cancer and
        out of all those that died, almost 1/5 was a result of lung cancer. While it is only fifth most commonly diagnosed, it has taken
        more lives than any of the other cancers in 2019. There were over 12 000 new cases and 9000 deaths in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lung Cancer also cost the Australian health service about 600 million out of the 6 billion in teh time between 2009 and
        2013. That's about 10% of the funding and is the thrid most expense cancer after bowel and breast cancer.
